## Routing

We are using the default router with no custom server.
For that, we have a router module the is created by the CLI `router/index.js`.

### Router

This is the place we will define all the routes and the components. We can import the components dynamically using inline imports.

`router/index.js`

```
import Vue from "vue";
import VueRouter from "vue-router";
import Home from "../views/Home.vue";  // importing component

Vue.use(VueRouter); // configuring to use VueRouter

// route config
cons routes=[
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "Home",
    component: Home,
  },
  {
    ......
  },
  {
    path:'*',       // default route
    redirect:'/'    // if no match redirect to home
  }
]

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

#### Navigation

In `App.Vue` we have

`<router-link to="/">Home</router-link>`.

This are link to nav links to the speciifed route. We have a `to` attribute which help us in definig the destination route.

`<router-view />`

The view is loaded inside the `<router-view />` according to the route we are in. You can think of it like a container were the current view is loaded as per the route we are in.

To navigate from code one can use `this.$router.push(route_name)` or `this.$router.replace(route_name)`

<hr />

### emit

To trigger the method in parent from child component one can use the `$emit` method.

```
<child-component @click="$emit(event_name)">

<parent-component @event_name="handler">
```
